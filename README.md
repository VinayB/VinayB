- 👋 Hi, I’m @VinayB
- 👀 I’m interested in learning front end technologies, scalable backend solutions, distributed databases, security, Ai, ML, Mixed reality, Game Development and Metahuman creations.
- 🌱 I’m currently dropping in and out of development activities. Geeting into regular consistent development and learning activities hasn't been easy. Currently trying to develop some utilities for my own use. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Mixed Reality, Front End Tech, MetaHumans, Game Development and small assignment to make me learn :)
- 📫 How to reach me - email me on b_vinay@hotmail.com. I am usally responsive and tend to respond within 24 hours, unless it is a weekend and I am gone for a long ride.
